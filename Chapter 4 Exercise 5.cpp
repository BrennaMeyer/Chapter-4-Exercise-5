//Requirements: Body Mass Index
//Write a program that calculates and displays a person’s body mass index(BMI).
// The BMI is often used to determine whether a person is overweight or underweight for his or her height.
// A person’s BMI is calculated with the following formula :
//BMI = weight×703 / height2
//where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches.
// The program should display a message indicating whether the person has optimal weight, is underweight, or is overweight.
// A person’s weight is considered to be optimal if his or her BMI is between 18.5 and 25. 
// If the BMI is less than 18.5, the person is considered to be underweight.
// If the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered to be overweight.
